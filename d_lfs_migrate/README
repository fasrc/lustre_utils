NAME
    d_lfs_migrate - distributed, combined lsf find and lfs_migrate

SYNOPSIS
    d_lfs_migrate --ost-number-base BASE --ost OST_NUMBER... PATH_TO_MIGRATE

DESCRIPTION
    This is a tool to use for evacuating data from lustre OSTs or rebalancing 
    data on OSTs when adding new ones.  The standard procedure for this -- 
    walking the filesystem with lfs find and passing files to migrate to 
    lsf_migrate -- is a serial operation that does not take advantage of 
    lustre's parallel, high-performance nature.  This tool uses libdftw and MPI 
    to parallelize this procedure.

    We've seen strong scaling efficiency of ~80% when running 20-way parallel 
    on nodes already running mixed workloads, and thus far have stopped there 
    without any further investigation or optimization... better performance is 
    quite likely possible!

    All the normal preparations and warnings regarding lfs_migrate apply:

        - The files to be migrated must not be in use.

        - The OSTs should be deactivated on the MDS (but not on clients).

        - This does not migrate files with multiple hard links.  lfs_migrate 
          can be made to, but this does not pass along those options.  See 
          `lfs_migrate_hardlinks' in https://github.com/fasrc/lustre_utils/ for 
          a better approach.

    This has not been tested on striped files, but it should work.  There are 
    also some limits on ost and stripe count that have compile-time overrides 
    (look at the code).

    This code does a fork/exec (when not running with --find-only), which MPI 
    will usually complain about at runtime.  You can suppress this warning (in 
    OpenMPI) with: 

        -mca mpi_warn_on_fork 0

OPTIONS
    -o, --ost OST_NUMBER
        Migrate files off of OST_NUMBER.  Specify multiple times if multiple 
        OSTs are being migrated (hint: use shell brace expansion, e.g. 
        -o{5..9}, to easily specify a range).

    -b, --ost-number-base BASE
        The numeric base used to interpret OST_NUMBER.  Valid values are 10 
        and 16.  Since both are used by various other tools, this option is 
        required, out of an abundance of caution.

    -n, --find-only
        Don't actually migrate the files, just print out the names of files 
        that would be migrated.  This is analagous to lfs_migrate's -n, but 
        lfs_migrate is not even called in this case.

    -h, --help
        Print this help.

REQUIREMENTS
    lustre 1.8.7 or compatible
